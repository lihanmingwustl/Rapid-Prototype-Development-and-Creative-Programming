# Multi-room Chat Server #

This chat service will contain a main lobby where users sign on with a nickname and can communicate with each other. 
Users may also create chat rooms for other to join. 
The entire app should be displayed on a single webpage, listing the room you are in, all available rooms, and the users in the current room.

And also, for the creative portion, i did a new function which can allow us to grant the onwnership of the room. 
Normally the owner of a room is the person who create it. 
When the owner chooses to give the ownership, it can grant others to be the owner of the room.
Also, when send private message, i change the font color to blue, to distinguish from normal message.
